- **teachers**: Teacher information and credentials
- **classes**: Class information with homeroom teacher references
- **students**: Student information and class assignments
- **attendances**: Daily attendance records
- **absent_requests**: Student absence requests with approval workflow
- **admins**: Administrator accounts with authentication and status management

All tables include:
- Auto-incrementing primary keys
- Created/updated timestamps
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Check constraints for status fields

## Photo Management

The API supports profile photo uploads for both teachers and students with AWS S3 integration:

### Features
- **File Upload**: Multipart form-data upload support
- **S3 Storage**: Photos are stored securely in AWS S3
- **Signed URLs**: Secure photo access with time-limited signed URLs
- **Format Support**: Common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
- **Automatic Path Updates**: Database records are updated with S3 keys
- **Photo Retrieval**: Get secure photo URLs with expiration times
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error responses

### Requirements
- AWS S3 bucket configured with proper permissions
- Environment variables for AWS credentials set up
- Maximum file size limits enforced by the server

### API Endpoints
- `PUT /api/v1/teachers/{id}/photo` - Upload teacher profile photo
- `GET /api/v1/teachers/{id}/photo` - Get teacher profile photo (signed URL)
- `PUT /api/v1/students/{id}/photo` - Upload student profile photo
- `GET /api/v1/students/{id}/photo` - Get student profile photo (signed URL)

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Upload teacher photo
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/teachers/1/photo \
  -F "photo=@teacher-photo.jpg"

# Get teacher photo (signed URL)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/teachers/1/photo

# Upload student photo  
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students/1/photo \
  -F "photo=@student-photo.jpg"

# Get student photo (signed URL)
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/students/1/photo
```

### Upload Response Format
```json
{
  "translate_key": "success.photo_uploaded",
  "message": "Photo uploaded successfully",
  "path": "https://bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com/photos/teachers/1/teacher_1_1704067200.jpg"
}
```

}
```

**Note**: The GET photo endpoint returns a signed URL that expires after a specified time (15 minutes for students, 1 hour for teachers) for security purposes.

### Technical Implementation
The photo management system uses several new repository methods:

#### Repository Methods
- `UpdatePhotoPath(ctx context.Context, id uint, photoPath string) error` - Updates the photo path in the database
- `GetPhotoPath(ctx context.Context, id uint) (string, error)` - Retrieves the photo path from the database

#### S3 Configuration Methods
- `UploadFile(client *s3.Client, key string, body []byte) error` - Uploads file to S3
- `GetObjectURL(key string) string` - Gets public S3 object URL
- `GetSignedURL(client *s3.Client, key string, expires time.Duration) (string, error)` - Generates presigned URLs

#### File Storage Structure
Photos are organized in S3 with the following structure:
```
photos/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ teachers/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {teacher_id}/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ teacher_{id}_{timestamp}.{extension}
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ students/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {student_id}/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ student_{id}_{timestamp}.{extension}
```

## Password Management

The API provides secure password management functionality for both teachers and students:

### Features
- **Password Reset**: Administrators can reset user passwords and generate new secure passwords
- **Password Update**: Users can change their own passwords by providing old and new passwords
- **Secure Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt with configurable salt rounds

    "new_password": "new_secure_password"
  }'
```

### Response Formats

#### Reset Password Response
```json
{
  "translate_key": "success.password.reset",
  "message": "Password reset successfully",
  "newPassword": "GeneratedSecurePassword123"
}
```

#### Update Password Response
```json
{
  "translate_key": "success.password.updated",
  "message": "Password updated successfully"
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Reset password generates a new secure random password
- Update password requires knowledge of the current password
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
- Password complexity is handled by the generation algorithm
- User existence is verified before any password operations

### Usage Examples

#### Create Admin Account
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admins \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@school.com",
    "password": "securepassword123",
    "is_active": true
  }'
```

#### Deactivate Admin Account
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/v1/admins/1/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

    "is_active": false
  }'
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "translate_key": "success.admin_created",
  "message": "Admin created successfully"
}
```

### Security Features
- Email-based authentication and identification
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Account activation/deactivation controls
- Password update requires current password verification
- Admin existence validation before operations

## Authentication & Authorization

The API provides comprehensive JWT-based authentication for three user types: admin, teacher, and student.

### Features
- **JWT Token Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with 1-hour expiration
- **Multi-User Type Support**: Admin, teacher, and student authentication with different credentials
- **Redis Token Caching**: Tokens are cached in Redis for fast validation and logout functionality
- **Automatic Token Expiration**: Tokens expire after 1 hour for enhanced security
- **Role-Based Access**: Different user types have different access levels
- **Secure HTTP-Only Cookies**: Tokens are also stored in secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Dual Authentication Support**: Both Bearer tokens and cookies are supported
- **Secure Logout**: Token invalidation through Redis cache removal and cookie clearing

### Authentication Flow
1. **Login**: User provides user_type, user_id, and password
2. **Validation**: System validates credentials based on user type:
   - Admin: Uses email and password from admins table
   - Teacher: Uses teacher_id and password from teachers table
   - Student: Uses student_id and password from students table
3. **Token Generation**: JWT token is generated with user information and 1-hour expiration
4. **Redis Caching**: Token is cached in Redis with expiration
5. **Cookie Setting**: Secure HTTP-only cookie is set with the token
6. **Role Assignment**: User role is embedded in JWT claims for access control
7. **Response**: Client receives JWT token in both response body and secure cookie

### Using Authentication

#### Login Process
```bash
# Admin login (use email as user_id)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_type": "admin",
    "user_id": "admin@school.com", 
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# Teacher login (use teacher_id as user_id)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_type": "teacher",
    "user_id": "TCH001",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# Student login (use student_id as user_id)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_type": "student", 
    "user_id": "STU001",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

#### Using JWT Tokens
There are two ways to authenticate with the API:

**Method 1: Authorization Header (Bearer Token)**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/teachers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
```

**Method 2: HTTP-Only Cookie (Automatic)**
```bash
# Cookie is automatically included in subsequent requests after login
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/teachers \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt --cookie cookies.txt
```

#### Logout
Logout works with either authentication method:

**With Bearer Token:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

**With Cookie:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/logout \
  --cookie-jar cookies.txt --cookie cookies.txt
```

**Note**: Logout clears both the Redis cache and the HTTP-only cookie for complete session termination.

### Token Structure
JWT tokens contain the following claims:
- `user_id`: The user's identifier (email for admin, teacher_id for teacher, student_id for student)
- `user_type`: The type of user (admin, teacher, student)
- `exp`: Token expiration timestamp
- `iat`: Token issued at timestamp

### Middleware Features
The authentication middleware provides:
- **JWTMiddleware**: Requires valid JWT token for all protected routes
- **OptionalJWTMiddleware**: Validates token if provided, continues without if not
- **RequireUserType**: Restricts access to specific user types (Admin, Teacher, Student)

**Middleware Implementation:**
- All API route groups use `JWTMiddleware` for authentication
- Admin routes additionally use `RequireUserType("admin")` 
- Absent Request routes use `RequireUserType("student", "teacher")`

### Security Considerations
- Tokens are cached in Redis and validated on each request
- Expired tokens are automatically removed from Redis
- Admin accounts can be deactivated, preventing login even with valid passwords
- All passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
- Token expiration is enforced both in JWT claims and Redis cache
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS attacks by making tokens inaccessible to JavaScript
- Secure flag ensures cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS
- SameSite=Strict prevents CSRF attacks
- Logout immediately invalidates tokens by removing them from Redis and clearing cookies

### Authentication Error Responses

#### Missing Authentication
```json
{
  "translate_key": "error.token_required",
  "error": "Authorization token is required"
}
```

#### Invalid Token Format
```json
{
  "translate_key": "error.invalid_token_format", 
  "error": "Token must be in format: Bearer <token>"
}
```

#### Expired Token
```json
{
  "translate_key": "error.token_expired",
  "error": "Token has expired"
}
```

#### Insufficient Permissions
```json
{
  "translate_key": "error.insufficient_permissions",
  "error": "Insufficient permissions for this operation"
}
```

**Common HTTP Status Codes:**
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing, invalid, or expired token
- `403 Forbidden`: Token valid but insufficient permissions for the endpoint
- `200 OK`: Successful authentication and authorized access

## Security Features

- Password fields are automatically excluded from JSON responses
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Request logging middleware
- Secure file upload with AWS S3 integration

## Error Handling

The API returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "error": "Description of the error"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request (invalid input)
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Pagination

List endpoints support pagination with query parameters:
- `limit`: Number of items to return (default: 10, max: 100)
- `offset`: Number of items to skip (default: 0)

Example:
```bash
GET /api/v1/students?limit=20&offset=40
```
